/*
Column aliases are used mainly to shorten code and make column names more readable.

Code becomes shorter as long table names and unnecessary identification of columns (e.g., there may be 2 IDs in the table,
but only one is used in the statement) can be avoided. Along with table aliases this allows you to use longer descriptive
names in your database structure while keeping queries upon that structure concise.

Furthermore they are sometimes required, for instance in views, in order to name computed outputs.

-- Aliases can be created in all versions of SQL using double quotes (").
SELECT
  FName AS "First Name",
  MName AS "Middle Name",
  LName AS "Last Name"
FROM Employees

-- You can use single quotes ('), double quotes (") and square brackets ([]) to create an alias in Microsoft SQL Server.
SELECT
  FName AS "First Name",
  MName AS 'Middle Name',
  LName AS [Last Name]
FROM Employees

/*
This statement will return FName and LName columns with a given name (an alias). This is achieved using the AS operator
followed by the alias, or simply writing alias directly after the column name. 

This means that the following query has the same outcome as the above.

SELECT
  FName "First Name",
  MName "Middle Name",
  LName "Last Name"
FROM Employee

/*
However, the explicit version (i.e., using the AS operator) is more readable.
If the alias has a single word that is not a reserved word, we can write it without single quotes, double quotes or brackets:

SELECT
  FName AS FirstName,
  LName AS LastName
FROM Employees

-- alias is used in string concatenation 
SELECT 
  FirstName + ' ' + LastName As FullName
  FullStreetAddress As Addr1,

FROM CustomerDetails

-- Also, if you need to use reserved words, you can use brackets or quotes to escape:
SELECT
  FName as "SELECT",
  MName as "FROM",
  LName as "WHERE"
FROM Employees

-- Also, a column alias may be used any of the final clauses of the same query, such as an ORDER BY
SELECT
  FName AS FirstName,
  LName AS LastName
Employees
ORDER BY LastName DESC

/*
To create an alias from these reserved words (SELECT and FROM).
This will cause numerous errors on execution.
