/*
NULL means missing information or not applicable or missing value. 

NULL is not a value, therefore, you cannot compare it with any other values like numbers or strings. The comparison of NULL
with a value will always result in NULL, which means an unknown result.

In addition, NULL is not equal to NULL so the following expression returns NULL:

NULL = NULL

When filtering for NULL in WHERE blocks is slightly different than filtering for specific values.

We use IS NULL for null
